I'm a programmer living in Aalter, Belgium, who works for a startup, named [Fission](https://fission.codes/). I love great [music](https://soundcloud.com/purplesynth/likes), [books](books/) and [quotes](http://quotes.fission.app/). I also dabble in [electrical engineering](http://circuits.icidasset.com/).
